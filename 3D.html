<h3>To create an environment</h3>
<p class="blocktext">We know that the human brain has more memory for the image than the sound,
 and the sound is stronger than the text. So if we convert it into an image when we 
memorize the text, we will remember it very firmly. If we turn it into an image and 
 the sound and add the feeling of touch will be even stronger.
I want to create an environment to make people stay with themselves and to awareness of their imagination and interact with. To make people feel they are in another unreal world. To creat this unreal and dreamy feelings to make people more foucs on themselves. </p>
<p class="blocktext"> The subconscious does not make conscious choices and contrasts, but only unconditionally accepts the advice given by consciousness.Once the concept of consciousness is accepted, it immediately begins to transform it into reality.The subconscious does not have an independent personality.

Therefore, control your own consciousness and carefully choose ideas and 
concepts at the level of consciousness.</p>
