	<h2> Concept </h2>

<p class="blocktext"> 
Awake (觉醒) </p>
<p class="blocktect">a·wake </p>

<p class="blocktect">verb </p>

	<p class="blocktext"> <span>make people to awake to awarness to think. </span> The idea of awake, it was influenced by life and also by certain sci-fi movies. <em> Parpika,Perfect Blue, The Matrix and Blade Runner.</em> I'm very into the action of people to start to awake. 
	During my mind research, a ted talk by Oliver Sacks, Neurologist, about what hallucination reveals about our minds. Oliver brings the attention that when visually impaired people experience lucid hallucinations. Which is also called people's imagination. So I decided to use physical computing and human behavior to create a project base on using imagination and interaction to make this awake project can be come true. </p>

The reason I’m here to find you because this world is crazy, it is not as peaceful as people think as. This world was controlled by 10 large families, they are evil.” Evan asked: “Why? Why they are evil?”  The man answered :” because Artificial intelligence has become the brain of people, and people’s bodies are just a body. ” Evan :  “What do you need me for?” The man: “ I need your help to build this thinking machine for people. This idea was actually your father’s idea, but he and your mother was killed when you were 4 years old, because those people found out what he wants to do, they killed them. I’m sorry to let you know this. I was the person sent you to the orphanage, before they find you. I’m sorry Evan. ”   Evan was shocked and angry, his parents, he has parents.

At the time when they start to play the game they will start to think again they will start to awareness their life and their surroundings and this world, but we need to make sure their AI steward won’t notice it. People gonna wake up gradually, even themselves won’t notice it.” Evan got so many questions in his mind. “How is it gonna work?” The man firm answer to : “Remember we see with the eyes, but we see with brain as well, and seeing with the brain is often called imagination. hallucination reveals about our minds. We need to make people to use their imagination to awake themselves. What we need to do we just need to build this “toy” and sell it to this world. And use human behavior to make them to awake.”
