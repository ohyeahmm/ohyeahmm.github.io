<h2> iXpand Mini Flash </h2>
<div class="a">
<p class="blocktext" size="15"> iXpand Mini is a flash drive that can directly download or upload files through their app iXpand drive to your phone. It is portable and very small size, the transmission rate is reached to 90MB/S. It is an ideal flash drive for people who need more space for their phone and the computer is not around them, also to transfer the files by using the phone. As an Apple-certified flash memory disk, the iXpand Mini can meet the needs of most users in terms of design and packaging. It is also simple enough in terms of transmission speed and mobile phone connection, and can easily help users to complete the expansion of mobile phones. </p>

<p class="blocktext">However, as a user, I only used this product once. There are several reasons I will state to explain them below. It is all about the app 'iXpand drive’, first of all when I open this app, there are too many things going on the main page of the app, and the design of the app looks very old version like some app we used 10 years ago. Secondly,  when I was trying to transfer photos to the drive if over 300 images, the app will crash, or sometimes after you waited for more than 30mins and in the end the transfer is unsuccessful. The last thing to mention about this app is that the way they named the file is very complicated very long, and sometimes when I view the images if I want to go back, it will bring you to the top of the column. </p>

<p class="blocktext">As a designer, what I would suggest to this app, first they need to redesign the app to a simple and clean design. Easy for people to understand what are they using. On the main page just needs to show transfer files and review files from the flash. Secondly, they should update the speed of transfer files or images, or they can limit the user only can transfer 150 images each time, so the app won’t crash. The last thing I want to suggest is how they name the file, I understand they don’t want people to overload the files. They can start with ixpand01.ipg some thing like this. Instead of something like this kashfiehiohgsdahgkdhgoih1244skhksdhkg.</p></div>
