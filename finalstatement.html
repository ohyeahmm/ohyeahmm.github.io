	<h1> Final Project Statement of Intent</h1>


<div class="a">

<p class="blocktext" size="15"> Feel happy feel good is getting hard and hard nowadays, people are very easy to feel depressed because of the high pressure of the society and their surroundings. My goal is to make people to feel better and feel satisfied by the action of interaction. About my research area I’m focusing on haptic, human behavior and anthropomorphism. The reason I’m chose these three area for my domain because I want to make some thing to make people feel satisfied and good, I wants to know how can they feel good with the way of doing things. Which behavior can make people feel good. About haptics interface, I want to make people to feel about the interaction with their hand, according to the research the longer the interval between the stimulus task and the recognition task, the worse the ability to recognize such items. At the same time, comparing the three stimuli of hearing, touch and vision, the researchers found that the auditory stimuli that participants can remember are not accurate. Visual stimuli and tactile stimuli that can be remembered are more accurate, and there is not much difference in the level of memory between the two sensations. This experimental result can be applied to teaching. These results show that simply listening to the teacher is not the best way to get information. Introducing visual factors or hands-on links in teaching will help students better remember their knowledge. 
After I decided my domain, I started with these two creative question to lead myself to my final project. How can we use haptic interface to make people to “see” motion graphic better?Can we use air as the medium to create artworks? I want to use air as my haptic interface. The precedents : Berndnaut smilde “Clouds”/ Rita McBrid “Particulates” / Pablo Picasso “Drawing in light” / Anthony McCall / James Turrell / Museum of feelings / Harpreet “weather reporter”/ zero blaster gun/
My concepts for my final project:
Concept 1:
To create a small dark clouds and lighting in the cloud in a glass cube, create and interface for people to change the weather, use variation to make people feel about the lighting. Use soft cotton to make people feel the clouds. People have to shake the interface to make the dark clouds away and which can change the weather to white cloud with rainbow. Use weather change to make people feel satisfied.
